Gehackt is a group formed to combat restrictions in my school :>>

So, you know how ChromeOS is shitty? Wanna make it better?
Are you...  On school wifi? Look here.

Normally, you'd have to install the ChromeOS Linux Development Environment to run APK files (android apps)
For a workaround, we use 'chromeos-apk'. It converts apk files, to Google Chrome extensions!

This enables fields of workarounds. The Tor Browser is one click away, and since it does not have Gogaurdian installed onto it, it is able to bypass the blocking system. Gehackt offers this for free.

Gehackt offers apps like Discord, Pinterest, many browsers, Minecraft PE, Spotify, Soundcloud, Tiktok, Roblox, Chrunchyroll, Youtube, Photomath, Microsoft Math, Google Chat, Text Free, Twitter (X), and GTA San Andreas.

The goal of Gehackt is to enable gaming, social media, and bypassing to school chromebooks all over the world!
